# DesignPatterns

This repository was created in order to follow the uDemy course:

**Java Design Patterns & SOLID Design Principles**

## Overview

    This course starts with SOLID Design Principles in Java. It will then provide a comprehensive introduction to Java Design patterns with practical, hands on exercises.

## SOLID Design Principles

SOLID design principles are almost a mandatory skill for every Java developer. These principles enable you to write most reusable & clean Java code in your projects. The SOLID Principles are:

* Single Responsibility Principle
* Open-Closed Principle
* Liskov Substitution Principle
* Interface Segregation Principle
* Dependency Inversion Principle

## Java Design Patterns

You'll find the following patterns:

* Creational Design Patterns: Simple Factory, Abstract Factory, Factory Method, Singleton, Builder, Prototype & Object Pool
* Structural Design Patterns: Object & Class Adapters, Decorator, Bridge, Facade, Static & Dynamic Proxy, Flyweight & Composite  
* Behavioral Design Patterns: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Mediator, Iterator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor, & Null Object

### What are Design Patterns & why should you care?

Design patterns represent solutions to common problems, which you face while doing programming. These solutions are reusable and can solve a wide variety of problems. These became popular with the release of classic book on the subject "Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" writtern by Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson and Richard Helm (these authors are known as Gang of Four and so the common abbreviation GoF book :) )
One problem while studying this book as a Java developer is that the authors are using C++ to demonstrate a pattern, which was the most popular & widely used programming language at the time. So you'll see examples using C++ language features like pointers, copy constructors etc. which do not translate easily to Java.
This course will help greatly in that aspect. We'll study each design pattern using Java to its full potential.
