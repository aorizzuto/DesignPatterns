# DesignPatterns

This repository was created in order to follow the uDemy course:

**Java Design Patterns & SOLID Design Principles**

You'll find the following patterns:

* Builder



Course Overview

    This course starts with SOLID Design Principles in Java. It will then provide a comprehensive introduction to Java Design patterns with practical, hands on exercises.



What are SOLID Design Principles?

SOLID design principles are almost a mandatory skill for every Java developer. These principles enable you to write most reusable & clean Java code in your projects.

You'll learn SOLID Principles which are:

Single Responsibility Principle

Open-Closed Principle

Liskov Substitution Principle

Interface Segregation Principle

Dependency Inversion Principle



All these principles are explained in detail and you'll refactor existing Java code and apply these principles in hands on exercise along with me.

Then we move on to Java Design Patterns.

To learn about the design patterns using Java programming language we'll discuss:   

    Learn what kind of problems are solved by each design pattern.

    Discuss various roles in the design pattern using UML diagrams.

    We'll use UML of example that we are going to solve as well as UMLs from gang of four book

    Discuss how the design  pattern is applied in the example & how various parts fit together.

    Hands on example using Java in Eclipse IDE that uses the design pattern.

    Various design & implementation considerations for every design pattern.

    Discuss how the design pattern varies from another similar pattern.

    See where a design pattern is used in real life.

This course covers all the classic design patterns from the Gang of Four (GoF) book. In addition we'll discuss few newer design patterns that are used in modern software development. We'll discuss how a pattern can be implemented in various ways & how we can tailor them to be used with Java language.

This course is the Most Comprehensive course on Java Design Patterns that you can find.



So, what are Design Patterns & why should you care?

    Design patterns represent solutions to common problems, which you face while doing programming. These solutions are reusable and can solve a wide variety of problems. These became popular with the release of classic book on the subject "Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" writtern by Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson and Richard Helm (these authors are known as Gang of Four and so the common abbreviation GoF book :) )
    One problem while studying this book as a Java developer is that the authors are using C++ to demonstrate a pattern, which was the most popular & widely used programming language at the time. So you'll see examples using C++ language features like pointers, copy constructors etc. which do not translate easily to Java.
    This course will help greatly in that aspect. We'll study each design pattern using Java to its full potential.



What is covered in this course?

    This course covers SOLID Design Principles and 26 design patterns in all. We'll cover following:

SOLID Design Principles: Learn about Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation & Dependency Inversion principles.

Creational Design Patterns: Simple Factory, Abstract Factory, Factory Method, Singleton, Builder, Prototype & Object Pool

Structural Design Patterns: Object & Class Adapters, Decorator, Bridge, Facade, Static & Dynamic Proxy, Flyweight & Composite  

Behavioral Design Patterns: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Mediator, Iterator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor, & Null Object

    Each design patterns is also implemented in a follow along coding lecture.



How the Course is Structured?

    We focus on live coding along with theory. Each design is implemented in a live coding session (which you can follow along) as well as discussed with UML & slides. After studing a section you'll know almost everything about the design pattern.

    This course is created with focus on being used as a reference. So each design pattern is discussed in it's own section with a separated lecture for each aspect of the design pattern. Each section is organized as following lectures:
    1. Introduction - This lecture introduces pattern, a problem that it solves & a formal UML diagram
    2. Implementation Steps - This lecture will discuss how you'll implement this pattern in Java.
    3. Example UML - We discuss the UML of the hands on problem we're going to solve.
    4. Implementation - In this lecture we'll implement the design pattern in Java using Eclipse IDE
    5. Implementation & Design Considerations - Some important points about performance, variations & practical advice on using the pattern
    6. Real World Example - In this lecture we'll see how the pattern is used in real life by Java's own class library & popular frameworks like Spring, JSF
    7. Comparison with Similar pattern - See how the pattern is different than another similar pattern.
    8. Pitfalls - Many pattern have some drawbacks. This lecture will show you what those are.
    9. Summary - This lecture will summarise all the information about the pattern.

    As you can see, by breaking a single design pattern in smaller topics, you can easily watch only those parts that you need in future.



What is provided with the Course?

 We have provided all code samples from the hands on lectures. You can download the starter code & follow along or you can download the finished code to study on your own.

 All UML diagram with description of each role in the design pattern is provided as PDF in summary video. These slides are enough to quickly revise design pattern structure.

A PDF guide to all design pattern summaries with code samples and UML diagrams.

Who should take this Course?

Beginner as well as experience Developers.

Software Designers & Architects.
